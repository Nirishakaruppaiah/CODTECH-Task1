Overview of the project
Project: House price prediction usig linear regression
Objective: The objective of house price prediction using linear regression is to develop a model that accurately estimates the selling price of residential properties based on various influential factors. This model can be used by real estate professionals, home buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions regarding property valuation, investment opportunities, and market trends.
Key Activities: First, data collection is essential, where historical housing data including features like location, size, number of rooms, and age of the property are gathered. This data is then preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) follows, involving visualizations and statistical summaries to understand relationships between variables and identify patterns. Feature selection is crucial to identify the most significant predictors of house prices. The data is then split into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is built and trained using the training data. Model evaluation is performed using the testing set to assess performance metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE). If necessary, the model is refined through techniques like regularization to improve accuracy. Finally, the model is validated and deployed for predicting house prices on new data.
Technologies used:  House price prediction using linear regression typically involves a combination of various technologies and tools. Data collection and preprocessing often leverage programming languages such as Python or R, with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
